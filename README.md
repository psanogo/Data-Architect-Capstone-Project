# Data Architect Capstone Project: [Project Title]

## Overview

This repository contains the capstone project for the Data Architecture program. The goal of this project is to solve the business problem of [briefly describe the business problem, e.g., 'optimizing marketing spend by creating a single source of truth for customer interactions'] by designing and implementing a modern, scalable, and end-to-end data platform.

This solution processes raw data from various sources, transforms it into a clean and queryable format, and makes it available for analytics and business intelligence.

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end architecture of the data platform, from data ingestion to final visualization.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes data from the following sources:
*   **[Source 1, e.g., PostgreSQL Database]**: Contains [description of data, e.g., 'transactional sales data'].
*   **[Source 2, e.g., Google Analytics API]**: Provides [description of data, e.g., 'website user behavior and traffic data'].
*   **[Source 3, e.g., Public CSV files]**: Includes [description of data, e.g., 'demographic information from a public dataset'].

---

## Technology Stack

*   **Cloud Provider**: [e.g., Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Azure]
*   **Data Lake / Storage**: [e.g., Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Amazon S3]
*   **Data Warehouse**: [e.g., Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake]
*   **Data Ingestion**: [e.g., Airbyte, Fivetran, Custom Python Scripts]
*   **Data Transformation**: [e.g., dbt (Data Build Tool), Spark]
*   **Orchestration**: [e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster]
*   **BI & Visualization**: [e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI]
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: [e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation]

---

## Data Model

The data warehouse is structured using a **[e.g., Star Schema]**, with a central fact table for [e.g., `fct_orders`] and several dimension tables such as [e.g., `dim_customers`, `dim_products`]. This model is optimized for analytical queries and BI tool performance.

## ETL/ELT Pipeline

The data pipeline is orchestrated by [e.g., Airflow] and follows an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) approach:
1.  **Extract & Load**: Data is extracted from the sources and loaded into the data warehouse's raw/staging area by [e.g., Airbyte connectors].
2.  **Transform**: [e.g., dbt] is used to clean, model, and transform the raw data into the final star schema. This includes data quality tests to ensure reliability.

## Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites:**
*   [e.g., Python 3.9+]
*   [e.g., Terraform v1.x]
*   [e.g., dbt CLI v1.x]

**Instructions:**
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [URL]`
2.  [Add further setup steps, e.g., 'Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt']
3.  [Add configuration steps, e.g., 'Configure your dbt profiles.yml and Terraform variables']

---

## How to Run

1.  **Provision Infrastructure**: `cd terraform && terraform apply`
2.  **Run the ELT Pipeline**: Trigger the [e.g., `full_elt_pipeline`] DAG from the Airflow UI.
3.  **Run dbt models (manual)**: `cd dbt && dbt run`

## Key Insights & Dashboards

*   [Insight 1, e.g., 'Identified that customers acquired through paid search have a 20% higher lifetime value.']
*   [Insight 2, e.g., 'Seasonal trends show a peak in sales during Q4 for the "Electronics" category.']

## Future Improvements

*   Implement real-time data streaming for [e.g., 'website clickstream data using Kafka and Flink'].
*   Integrate machine learning models for [e.g., 'customer churn prediction'].
*   Add more robust data quality and anomaly detection monitoring.
